# Project-Minesweeper
Hello! This project was made using HTML, Javascript and CSS! In this project I implemented the game Minesweeper, which is basically a game where you have to open all the cells without opening any bomb from the field. The numbers from the opened boxes specify the number of neighbouring bombs. You can also place a Flag where you think it could be a bomb. 
I started with implementing the board and styling it and afterwards I moved to placing the bombs randomly on each row, implemented the left-click handler where I covered all the possible cases of a neighbouring bomb and then I implemented the right-click handler to place the flags in place. You can also see the number of flags you've placed, as it starts from the number of bombs which is 8 and decrements every time you place a flag. The flags can also be removed if you change your mind by pressing again right-click on the cell that you already have a flag. Enjoy!
